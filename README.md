# E-commerce Business Metrics Analysis

## Overview
This project is an analysis of key business metrics for an e-commerce company.
The goal of the analysis was to understand overall performance, customer behavior,
payment preferences, and operational issues related to order fulfillment.

The project was completed using Google Sheets with additional SQL queries for data exploration.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Google Sheets
- SQL (for data exploration and aggregation)
- Data visualization (charts and dashboard)

---

## Project Structure
- `ecommerce_business_metrics_analysis.pdf` — analytical report with EDA and conclusions
- `screenshots/dashboard.png` — dashboard with key metrics
- `screenshots/sql_*.png` — examples of SQL queries with results

---

## Dataset
The analysis is based on a training dataset representing e-commerce transactions
(orders, products, customers, payments, and delivery statuses).

Due to file size limitations, the full dataset is not included in this repository.
The PDF report contains representative fragments of the data for demonstration purposes.

## Key Areas of Analysis
- Overall order performance and delivery success rate
- Revenue, average order value, and sales volume
- Distribution of payment methods across countries
- Order status analysis (delivered, cancelled, returned, pending)
- Monthly dynamics of orders by product category
- Revenue distribution by product categories and countries

---

## Key Insights
- Less than a quarter of orders were successfully delivered, indicating operational issues.
- A high share of cancelled and returned orders suggests potential problems with logistics,
  product quality, or user experience.
- Payment preferences vary by country, with digital payment methods dominating overall.
- Sales show clear seasonality, with peaks in specific months.
- Some categories generate high revenue but require optimization to improve efficiency.

---

## Recommendations
- Investigate the main reasons for cancellations and returns at different stages of the order flow.
- Improve logistics and delivery processes to increase the share of successful orders.
- Focus on increasing repeat purchases through loyalty programs and targeted offers.
- Optimize less profitable product categories using promotions and cross-sell strategies.
- Use seasonal demand patterns for better planning of marketing campaigns and inventory.
